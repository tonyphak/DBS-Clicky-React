# React Clicky Game
## Dragon Ball Super Clicky Game
A clicky memory game using react
## Motivation
I wanted to create an app based on REACT that is client side without any backend
## Getting Started
The clicky game can be played here https://tonyphak.github.io/DBS-Clicky-React/
## Screenshots
1. The user must click on 12 cards without clicking the same card twice. Whenever the user click on a card they will receive 1 point. If they click the same card twice they lose and their score is recorded as the top score. 12 will be the game winning score
